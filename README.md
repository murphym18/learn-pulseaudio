# learn-pulseaudio

A place to create a simple pulse audio application. My goal is to list all available sources, and stream audio into my program from a microphone.

# Set up

I need to make sure certain dev libs are installed (so I can build).

- On ubuntu 18.04 I need the [pulseaudio dev package](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/amd64/libpulse-dev): `sudo apt install libpulse-dev`
